# StableRemaster
The goal of this project is to "Remaster" old animated content for viewing on a modern TV or phone. The largest issue when rewatching old content is the aspect ratio. Many shows and movies were developed for CRT TVs and didn't expect for Flatscreens to take over the world. We believe that Stable Diffusion can solve this problem. JUST PUT PROBLEM STATEMENT HERE.
